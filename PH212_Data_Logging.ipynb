    "Adding a way to retain the data collected by the temperature sensor we created. I accidentally must have somehow damaged my sd card breakout board (no clue why it won't work). Luckily I purchased another breakout board at the beginning of the term w/ integrated microcontroller and wifi, [board info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32). So now might be a good time to tinker with it and see if we can use it to send the readings from the temp sensor over the local network.\n",
